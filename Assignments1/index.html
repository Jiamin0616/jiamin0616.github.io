      <h2>Research question</h2>
      <h4 id="q1">
        Q1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first thing that catches my eye is the visual design of the
          website. The site uses a dynamic video background and 3D visual
          effects. Players explore the story through a scrolling interactive
          format. The website uses a high contrast color scheme throughout,
          bright and colorful at the same time full of vitality. Create a
          natural atmosphere with a beachside summer feel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q3">
        Q3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I dedicate the most time to appreciating the poetic interludes of the
          beach. The content centers on summer vitality, exploration, and
          freedom, resonating with the brand's emphasis on adventure and a
          high-performance lifestyle. Additionally, the content is rich and
          vivid, seamlessly integrating elements of sports, entertainment, and
          nature.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q4">
        Q4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The most prevalent type is the sliding bearing, and users can access
          story details by clicking the corresponding button. Scrolling through
          the content reveals each node as a story chapter. On some pages, there
          may be a slight delay between scrolling actions and mouse
          interactions. In the poetic interlude section of the video, a low
          frame rate is employed, with text descriptions fading in and out for
          artistic effect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q5">
        Q5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The website's primary objective is to establish a dialogue with users
          through a series of immersive designs and interactive behaviors. The
          brand's ethos, as embodied in its name, is predicated on the values of
          freedom, fearlessness, energy, and exploration. The website has been
          designed to elicit a strong emotional response in users, thereby
          increasing interaction rates and engagement, and enhancing the
          perceived strength of the brand image.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q6">
        Q6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initially, the designers employed dynamic images, sounds, and
          scrolling animations to evoke users' imagination of summer, sunshine,
          the sea, and freedom. Not only that, but the video transitions were
          also very smooth and delicate, and the page transitions utilized
          fade-in/fade-out methods. Moreover, the integration of mouse-over
          interactions was accompanied by subtle animation feedback, providing a
          seamless and intuitive user experience. The design of the loading
          animations and progress bars adopted a soft and light form to maintain
          users' immersion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q7">
        Q7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I think "endless summer" is about a deep experience. The
          characteristics of this website can inspire users' empathy, with
          emotional marketing as the core. The content of the site creates more
          of a sense of storytelling. A lifestyle to aspire to, rather than
          showcasing product details and technology. More like a film or art
          exhibition than an e-commerce-style product site, it attracts groups
          with a desire for exploration and artistic aesthetics. As a result,
          users form a long-term memory and want to stay on the page for a
          while. Therefore, the user's browsing time should be in the ten to
          fifteen minutes, ranging from short-term will not revisit the
          situation. It is one of the sites that will leave a long-term
          effective memory, although it will not be browsed frequently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q8">
        Q8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, the site is meant to be a space for exploring, not a place to
          browse for information about products. The website has a relaxing and
          enjoyable atmosphere. The brand wants people to have a sensual
          experience, not just read information. The website doesn't have clear
          navigation, which makes it feel like you're exploring. This creates an
          added sense of mystery that makes you want to come back. Every click
          reveals something new.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, the website uses a large area of white space. Slow animation
          rhythm, short language, these give users the opportunity to savor and
          understand. At the same time, the story is special, which is the
          romantic memory of the summer. This gives users the opportunity to
          revisit the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Furthermore, the incorporation of a light and shadow effect feedback
          mechanism upon mouse clicks serves to enhance user engagement and
          interaction. This enhances the user's sense of engagement and
          involvement, fostering a desire to return to the platform. Finally,
          the player's ability to access non-linear memory enables the
          interpretation of content from diverse perspectives, thereby enhancing
          the overall experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q9">
        Q9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The website uses short films. The main visual design is to make the
          "reality" weaker and the "dream sense" stronger by using low-frame
          rate video and slow-paced text. The video uses the lens language to
          tell the story, emphasizing feelings rather than information. It's
          more like a timeline than a movie, where each scroll is a new story.
          At the same time, the music and images work together to create a more
          immersive experience for the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's also like a fun interactive installation experience. The user is
          not passively watching but is propelled by interaction. With every
          click and action, the user feels a sense of control. It can be said
          that it is an art installation that is easy to operate online.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the same time, the website is also very fashionable and novel in
          terms of page design. Some magazine styles are referenced here. Like
          large areas of white space, minimal text, advanced color matching and
          high contrast composition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q10">
        Q10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The website lets users participate in a way that isn't linear or
          focused on specific functions. It does this by using an immersive
          story, sensory activities, and emotional rhythm.
        </li>
        <li>
          The website guides users deeper by using atmosphere, rhythm, and
          pictures. The whole experience is immersive. Users don't have to think
          too much or look for answers. Just swipe the screen and the story
          unfolds. Although there is only one movement, it controls all the
          rhythm, including images, music, and words. Each pause in the music
          and words matches the rhythm of the images, which evokes the reader's
          emotions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The site guides the user smoothly through the experience with mouse
          scrolling and page response. This type of interaction emphasizes
          openness and memorability. The user doesn't need to return often, but
          leaves a lasting memory through audiovisual art. This can be
          transformed into a brand awareness that users can re-enter every
          summer in the future.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q11">
        Q11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This website has inspired me. Until now, I had always felt that
          immersive video was one-way, that the video communicated to the user
          rather than to each other. In this experience, I felt the charm of
          interactivity. As a participant, my feelings and participation are
          more important than observation and analysis. I can feel the
          resonance. It's a delicate sensory experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q12">
        Q12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
        what makes that part frustrating?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At first, I wasn't sure where to click. There are no obvious buttons
          or prompts. This can cause confusion. I'm always afraid of missing
          something, of not having a guiding "something." Then there are the
          sound effects. The autoplay music that starts when you turn it on
          surprised me. At the same time, there's a feeling that you have been
          listening to the same melody, and it's a little boring. The musical
          logic is lacking. In the end, the site used mostly linear browsing and
          hidden navigation. If you jump to watch or refresh in the middle of an
          easy-to-find way, you might miss it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="q13">
        Q13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One of the things I'm most pleased with is the visual design of the
          site. The main colours are dark blue and gold. It gives an immersive,
          clean, dreamy and natural vibe. The video uses beautiful shots of
          things like waves, sunshine, and the beach. The low frame rate
          faux-film filter creates a summer movie atmosphere. Like a wonderful
          and romantic dream.
