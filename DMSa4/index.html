          <h2>1. Purpose Judgment: My Expected Outcomes</h2>
          <p>
            In the initial prototype phase, I aimed to build a working native
            HTML5 Canvas demo that supports:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Uploading an image and having the Canvas automatically resize to
              the image dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Controlling the pixelation level via a
              <code>pixelSize</code> slider—larger values produce chunkier
              pixels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clicking an “Export PNG” button to download the current canvas
              view.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <!-- Initial Prototype Demo -->
          <section id="prototype-demo">
            <h3>Initial Prototype Demo</h3>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="img/p1.png"

              />
              <figcaption>
                Prototype UI: upload button, pixel size slider, colors input,
                filter dropdown, and export button.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              In this stage, I confirmed that native Canvas resizing,
              nearest-neighbor pixelation, and PNG export all work correctly.
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Next, I envisioned “gamifying” the entire tool with draggable,
            scalable, and flippable stickers and filters. Users could complete
            pixelation, sticker placement, and filter selection in just a few
            seconds. The goal was to create a “mini-game” feel rather than a
            professional photo editor—allowing users to quickly craft fun,
            pixelated posters and export them for sharing.

              <strong>Usability:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Although multiple features are integrated, every interaction
                  is designed to be “obvious at first glance, done in three
                  steps.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  Discarded complex color wheels and layer systems, retaining
                  only the “palette + nearest-neighbor color mapping” core
                  workflow.

                  Used native JavaScript + Canvas API to avoid large frameworks,
                  ensuring fast load and real-time rendering.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Early implementations called <code>getImageData</code> /
                  <code>putImageData</code> too frequently, causing stutters;
                  switching to a single-pass color-limiting algorithm greatly
                  improved responsiveness.

                  Interface colors, pixel fonts, and “glow buttons” were chosen
                  to evoke a Y2K nostalgia vibe, creating a sense of “retro

              <p>
                Early plans included “user profiles + multi-feature photo
                editor,” but this proved too ambitious. Final concept was
                narrowed to:
                <em>focus on photo pixelation + filters + stickers + export</em

              <strong>Technical Constraints:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Only native Canvas—no third-party rendering libraries. All
                  rendering and drag-and-drop logic is handwritten to deeply
                  understand the underlying APIs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No vector drawing—stickers only support “scale + flip
                  (horizontal/vertical),” omitting rotation/twist to reduce
                  complexity.
                </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Performance Boundaries:</strong>
              <p>A common issue was “pixelation too blurred”:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cause:</strong> <code>pixelSize</code> was too large,
                  so the Canvas scaling ratio and viewport didn't match.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fix:</strong> Dynamically scale the Canvas to keep it
                  visible, and set
                  <code>ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false</code> to preserve
                  crisp, blocky pixels.

                “Glow buttons” feature multi-gradient backgrounds plus

              <p>
                Filter & Sticker panels use semi-transparent white backgrounds,

              <strong>Pixelation Algorithm Evolution:</strong>
              <p>Original prototype:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Used <code>drawImage</code> to scale the image down to
                  <code>(width/size, height/size)</code> and then back
                  up—resulted in overly blurred, dull colors.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Improved flow:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Use Color Thief to extract a fixed palette.</li>
                <li>
                  For each pixel, find the nearest palette color and replace it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disable <code>ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled</code> and redraw
                  using nearest-neighbor scaling to preserve crisp pixel blocks.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <pre>
// In drawBase():
const smallW = Math.floor(canvas.width / size);
const smallH = Math.floor(canvas.height / size);
ctx.drawImage(baseImage, 0, 0, smallW, smallH);
let imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, smallW, smallH);
const data = imageData.data;
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
  // Compute nearestColor from palette
  data[i]   = nearestColor[0];
  data[i+1] = nearestColor[1];
  data[i+2] = nearestColor[2];
}
ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
ctx.drawImage(
  canvas,
  0, 0, smallW, smallH,
  0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height
);
            </pre
              >
              <p>
                This approach balances retro pixel aesthetics with clear color
                blocks, creating a sharper final visual.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sticker State Management:</strong>
              <p>
                Used an array
                <code
                  >stickers = [{ img, x, y, width, height, flipH, flipV },
                  …]</code
                >
                to store all sticker objects. In <code>drawSticker()</code>,
                iterate through this array to render each sticker. To handle
                flips, just toggle <code>flipH</code> /
                <code>flipV</code> flags.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Render Loop vs On-Demand Rendering:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Initially, <code>render()</code> was only called on user
                  interactions—which meant the sticker selection handles
                  wouldn't persistently show.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switched to a continuous
                  <code>requestAnimationFrame(animate)</code> loop, redrawing
                  every frame so dragging, scaling, and highlighting always stay
                  up to date.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <strong>Context Menu Implementation:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Listened for <code>contextmenu</code> on the Canvas, computed
                  mouse coordinates relative to the canvas, and identified which
                  sticker was clicked.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Positioned a pre-defined
                  <code>&lt;ul id="contextMenu"&gt;</code> at the mouse's
                  <code>e.clientX</code> / <code>e.clientY</code> and toggled
                  its <code>display</code> between <code>block</code> and
                  <code>none</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensured HTML <code>id="contextMenu"</code> exactly matched the

                  While debugging “click to add sticker, drag, right-click

            <li>
              <strong>Multi-Layer & Vector Drawing:</strong> Though I wanted
              Photoshop-style layered editing, the development timeline and
              complexity pushed this to future versions. Only single-layer
              pixelation + stickers is supported now.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-Time Animations & GIF Export:</strong> Early attempts
              with gif.js for frame-by-frame looping bogged down performance and
              increased bundle size, so static PNG export remains. Animated
              export is for a later release.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Sharing Integrations:</strong> Removed “one-click
              share to WeChat/Weibo” due to OAuth/API complexity. Focus was on a
              stable web experience first.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom Sticker Upload:</strong> Only a fixed, local
              sticker folder is used—no front-end drag-and-drop upload to server
              for now.

              The very first version simply rendered the uploaded image, applied
              nearest-neighbor pixelation on demand, and exported a static PNG.
              Canvas sizing issues were refined by ensuring proper
              <code>width/height</code> alignment with the image.

              <li>
                During early development, a stray <code>const w</code> variable
                was declared outside <code>drawBase()</code>, leading to “<code
                  >w is not defined</code
                >” errors. Moving the variable declaration inside the correct
                function scope (within <code>img.onload</code>) fixed this.
              </li>
              <li>
                Console occasionally showed “<code
                  >Cannot read properties of null (reading
                  'addEventListener')</code
                >,” because some event listeners ran before the DOM elements
                were created. Wrapping all <code>addEventListener</code> calls
                in a <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> listener resolved this.

                  type 'ImageDataSettings'</code
                >” warning appeared when <code>getImageData</code> was given
                non-integer dimensions. By adding <code>Math.floor()</code> to
                the width/height calculations, all pixel sizes are now integers
                and the warning disappeared.

              <strong>Add Sticker Library:</strong> Load a set of PNG sticker
              assets onto the Canvas, supporting drag-and-drop placement and

              <code>ctx.globalCompositeOperation</code> to toggle between eraser
              and normal modes.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Filters:</strong> Introduce custom shaders (e.g.,

          <h2>11. Conclusion: Project Evolution & Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            From the initial native Canvas prototype of “Upload → Pixelate →
            Export” to the current integrated version with stickers, filters,
            sound effects, and UI refinements, the core concept has always
            revolved around
            <em>“lightweight, playful, and easy to use.”</em> Each iteration
            struck a balance between user experience, visual style, and
            performance. Negative decisions helped focus on core features rather
            than building everything at once. In the future, multi-layer
            editing, animated GIF export, and social sharing could be added on
            this solid foundation.

            &gt; The above content combines key screenshots from each stage,
            code errors encountered, and compatibility fixes to clearly
            illustrate the evolution from prototype to the current release. Each
            technical challenge and design trade-off aimed to help users create
            fun pixel art posters as if “playing a mini-game” and export them
            effortlessly.

          <h2>12. Bug Demonstration: GIF Sticker Loading Failure</h2>

          <!-- 12.1 Before Fix -->
          <h3>12.1 Before Fix (CORS Error)</h3>
          <p>
            Below is a screenshot showing how GIF stickers fail to load due to
            CORS policy restrictions:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/p5.png" alt="GIF Sticker CORS Error Example" />
            <figcaption>
              Console error: “Access to image at
              'https://tenor.com/…/gdkAz8TKiHk.gif' from origin
              'http://127.0.0.1:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy.”<br />
              Result: Sticker panel shows broken-image icons.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <!-- 12.2 After Fix -->
          <h3>12.2 After Fix (Sticker Loads Normally)</h3>
          <p>
            After adding a simple proxy or hosting the GIFs on the same domain,
            stickers load correctly and no CORS errors appear:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="img/p6.png"
              alt="GIF Sticker Loads Correctly, No Console Errors"
            />
            <figcaption>
              Console: no CORS errors. Sticker panel now displays animated GIF
              thumbnails as expected.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This demonstrates that once the cross-origin issue is resolved, GIF
            stickers load as intended without any console errors.
